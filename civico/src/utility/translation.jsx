      <div>
        The point of AI is to save you time and energy. At the same time, real
        education is about challenging yourself so that you can create real
        knowledge. In short, you'll work through 100+ questions and it will
        introduce you to building your ideas with software, learning computer
        science and creating opportunities for yourself with good technology.
        <br />
        <br />
        I also want to teach you quickly, effectively and in a similar fashion
        to you having to pick up the skills on the job. At the end of the day, a
        software entrepeneur needs to learn about business, engineering,
        investing, marketing, sales, design and a number of other well-rounded
        skills in order to be successful, which is what we try to prepare you
        here with.
        <br />
        <br />
        There are many things beyond coding taught on RO.B.E, ranging from the
        psychology of self-esteem, to the development of startups distributed
        globally. You are encouraged to imagine, think big and work hard in
        order to find success here.
        <br />
        <br /> Civico is a service created by Robots Building Education, a
        platform founded on researching technology the following three
        priorities:
        <br /> <br />
        1. Every student should have access to many good teachers.
        <br />
        2. Online education should be the best education.
        <br />
        3. Learning creates scholarships.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is accomplished with the human-computer interaction discipline,
        which researches how to make technology more useful and meaningful. I
        personally revise anything done with AI to add human touch to it as to
        not offer cheap generated material but a genuine delivery of good
        quality education.
        <br />
        <br />
        The following are all the features and benefits you'll find across the
        platform which are typically free. As of now I just ask folks to
        optionally sign up for $10 to access more content around
        entrepreneurship, finance, and engineering to the work and to create a
        stronger network.
        <br />
        <br />
        Why so low for so much? I love education technology and I want to work
        on this platform until you feel it's worth supporting. I also believe
        that social media helps me reach so many people that keeping it low
        price is only fair. I would eventually like to explore teaching folks so
        we can create a pipeline to access more capital from folks eager to
        invest in diverse technology businesses.

        This platform will help you learn fast and effectively, but it is also

        for you to learn and grow using the power of AI. In short, doing things
        the gritty way is often more enjoyable and meaningful. If you come

        El prop칩sito de la IA es ahorrarte tiempo y energ칤a. Al mismo tiempo, la
        educaci칩n real consiste en desafiarte a ti mismo para que puedas crear
        conocimiento verdadero. En resumen, trabajar치s a trav칠s de m치s de 100
        preguntas y te introducir치n a la construcci칩n de tus ideas con software,
        aprendiendo ciencias de la computaci칩n y creando oportunidades para ti
        mismo con buena tecnolog칤a.
        <br />
        <br />
        Tambi칠n quiero ense침arte de manera r치pida, efectiva y similar a c칩mo
        tendr칤as que adquirir habilidades en el trabajo. Al final del d칤a, un
        emprendedor de software necesita aprender sobre negocios, ingenier칤a,
        inversi칩n, marketing, ventas, dise침o y una serie de otras habilidades
        completas para tener 칠xito, que es lo que intentamos prepararte aqu칤.
        <br />
        <br />
        En RO.B.E. se ense침an muchas cosas m치s all치 de la codificaci칩n, que van
        desde la psicolog칤a de la autoestima hasta el desarrollo de startups
        distribuidas globalmente. Se te anima a imaginar, pensar en grande y
        trabajar duro para encontrar el 칠xito aqu칤.
        <br />
        <br />
        El Programa AI App es un servicio creado por Robots Building Education,
        una plataforma fundada en la investigaci칩n de tecnolog칤a con las
        siguientes tres prioridades:
        <br />
        <br />
        1. Todo estudiante deber칤a tener acceso a muchos buenos maestros.
        <br />
        2. La educaci칩n en l칤nea deber칤a ser la mejor educaci칩n.
        <br />
        3. Aprender crea becas.
        <br />
        <br />
        Esto se logra con la disciplina de la interacci칩n humano-computadora,
        que investiga c칩mo hacer que la tecnolog칤a sea m치s 칰til y significativa.
        Yo personalmente reviso cualquier cosa hecha con IA para a침adirle un
        toque humano, de modo que no ofrezca material generado de manera barata,
        sino una entrega genuina de educaci칩n de buena calidad.
        <br />
        <br />
        A continuaci칩n se encuentran todas las caracter칤sticas y beneficios que
        encontrar치s en la plataforma, que t칤picamente son gratuitos. Por ahora,
        solo pido a las personas que opcionalmente se inscriban por $10 para
        acceder a m치s contenido relacionado con el emprendimiento, finanzas e
        ingenier칤a, y para crear una red m치s fuerte.
        <br />
        <br />
        쯇or qu칠 tan bajo precio por tanto? Me encanta la tecnolog칤a educativa y
        quiero trabajar en esta plataforma hasta que sientas que vale la pena
        apoyarla. Tambi칠n creo que las redes sociales me ayudan a llegar a
        muchas personas, por lo que mantener el precio bajo es lo justo.
        Eventualmente me gustar칤a explorar la ense침anza para que podamos crear
        un canal de acceso a m치s capital de personas deseosas de invertir en
        negocios tecnol칩gicos diversos.
